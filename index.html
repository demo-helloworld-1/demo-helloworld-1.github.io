            <h1>Worked on Client Project Implementing Voice Conversation IVR for one of the UseCase</h1>
            <p>Developed and implemented an IVR Bot for Currys, significantly reducing the workload on agents by automating ticket status updates. The bot efficiently handled over 1,000 calls daily from employees seeking quick updates on incident/request tickets, streamlining operations and enhancing productivity.</p>
            <p>Integrated API calls to the Ticket System to retrieve and cleanse data, extracting only the necessary information. Converted this data into conversational responses using TTS services, which were then delivered through the telephone layer, enhancing the efficiency and user experience of the IVR Bot.</p>
