        <h1>Trained more than 300+ Engineers on Google Cloud and Snowflake for cracking the Certification</h1>

        <p>Trained over 300 engineers on Google Cloud and Snowflake, focusing on certification preparation for the
            Professional Data Engineer and SnowPro Core certificates. As a Junior SME in Google Cloud Platform within
            the L&D team, I conducted virtual sessions with feedback ratings above 4.2, resulting in a high success rate
            among learners. Additionally, I led quick brush-up sessions on GCP Services, Azure Containers, and Data
            Fabric for over 100 learners, enhancing their skills and readiness for certification.</p>
